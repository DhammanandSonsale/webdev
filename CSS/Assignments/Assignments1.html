    <h1>ozymandias</h1>

    <!-- poet's name -->
    <h3>by percy bysshe shelley</h3>
    <p>
      I met a traveller from an antique land
      <br />
      Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br />
      Stand in the desart.[d] Near them, on the sand, <br />
      Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br />
      And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br />
      Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br />
      Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br />
      The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: <br />
      And on the pedestal these words appear: <br />
      "My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings: <br />
      Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" <br />
      No thing beside remains. Round the decay <br />
      Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br />
      The lone and level sands stretch far away. <br />
